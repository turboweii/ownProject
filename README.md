# ownProject
  My first project is Gitlet, which is from CS61B, all tests passed except remote part extra.Gitlet is a version-control system is essentially a backup system for related collections of files. The main functionality that Gitlet supports is:Saving the contents of entire directories of files. In Gitlet, this is called committing, and the saved contents themselves are called commits.Restoring a version of one or more files or entire commits. In Gitlet, this is called checking out those files or that commit.Viewing the history of your backups. In Gitlet, you view this history in something called the log.Maintaining related sequences of commits, called branches.Merging changes made in one branch into another.Remote part has not finished yet, meybe one day I will have some time to finsh it!
